cypress
- paralelization extra effort
 - does paralelization matter? (speed)
 - is paralelization possible with regard to our test strategy? (test data injection)
- problems with tscongfig references
- testing multiple tabs is not well supported. hacky workarounds needed.
- no multiple browsers at the same time
+ Readability (My opinion and https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/cypress-vs-playwright/)

playwright
- UI mode buggy (Screenshots go blank is the test has to scroll)
- multi tab and multi domain tests possible
- API more complex - stepper learning curve (My opinion and https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/cypress-vs-playwright/)
- not fool proof (missing "await" cause flaky tests)
